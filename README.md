# OpenGL Project
Simple OpenGL project in C exploring advanced rendering techniques using `glMultiDrawIndirect` and buffered uniforms, transforms, materials, etc.

Draws lots of colored cubes, a few `.obj` models, and a skybox using only 2 rendering calls per frame (objects and skybox).

Based on designs detailed in this [presentation](https://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2016/presentation/s6138-christoph-kubisch-pierre-boudier-gpu-driven-rendering.pdf) and its references.
